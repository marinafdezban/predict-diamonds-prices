The goal of this competition is the prediction of the price of diamonds based on their characteristics (carat, weight, color, cut...). This is an academic competition created for the students of Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp.

## :chart_with_downwards_trend: **Introduction**

Having an existing dataset of diamonds prices [located in Kaggle] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dapt202011mad/data), our main purpose is to develop the best model to predict the price of those diamonds.

## :bar_chart: Methodology

First, we clean our dataset and conduct a data analysis process (EDA). After that, we proceed to model the data through machine learning in order to find the most predictive model for the price of those diamonds.

The error metric used for this competition is the Root Mean Square Error.
